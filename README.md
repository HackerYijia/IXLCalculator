# JavaScript Calculator Bookmarklet 🖩

This project provides a JavaScript bookmarklet that allows users to create and remove a calculator instantly in their web browser. ✨

## Features ✨

- **Create Calculator**: With a single click, you can create a calculator element that appears on the web page. This calculator can be used for performing calculations without needing to navigate to a separate calculator app or website. ➕➖✖️➗

- **Remove Calculator**: If the calculator is no longer needed, you can easily remove it from the web page by clicking a button or triggering the bookmarklet again. ❌

- **Google Search Widget**: The bookmarklet includes a feature that allows users to search the web using Google without leaving the page. Upon activation, a search input will prompt the user to enter their search term, and the bookmarklet will open a new tab with the Google search results. 🔍🌐

- **YouTube Videos Popup Support**: Another feature of the bookmarklet is the ability to open YouTube videos as a popup. By providing the URL of a YouTube video, the bookmarklet will open the video in a separate popup window, allowing for convenient viewing while staying on the current web page. 🎥
